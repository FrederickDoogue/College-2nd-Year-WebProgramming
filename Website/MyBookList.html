<div align="Justify"><br>I love reading. The genres I love the most are action, adventure and fantasy. I read mostly fiction and hardly ever venture into the non-fiction book section unless by accident. So here is a short list of my favourite books and book series'.</div>
<br>
<div align="left"><H3>The Gone Series</h3></div>
<div align="Justify">The gone book series was written by Michael Grant and spans six books. In it everyone under the age of 15 mysteriously disappears and those that are left are stuck under a dome where some people sstart to develop unusual powers. It was a great read when I was younger and I still go back to it every now and again.</div>
<br>
<div align="left"><H3>Half Bad</h3></div>
<div align="Justify">A trilogy written by Sally Green it takes place in a modern day world with two warring groups of witches hidden from society. The main character Nathan who's parents come from differents side of the war must face hardships as he struggles to survive. I greatly enjoyed the first two books, the ending in the third left me feeling a bit confused and unsatisfied but other than that it was a fun journey to read.</div>
