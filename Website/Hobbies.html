<div align="Left"><H3>Rugby Union</h3></div>
<div align="Justify"><br>My main hobby is rugby union. I play with both the the local club, Carlow Coyotes and the IT Carlow team. There are one hour long trainging sessions at the College every Monday and Wednesday at 7:00. Carlow Coyote members can come and join those sessions along with attending a one hour long training seesion at the club on Fridays at 7:00. College matches tend to take place on Wednesdays while club matches take place during the weekends.</div> 
<div align="Justify"><br>I started playing four years ago but took a break when in 6th year. I started as forward as a second rower but am now in the backs as a winger. I have scored four trys in this time span with three of them coming from one game, so my one and only hatrick. It was a very good game for myself and the team.</div>
<div align="Justify"><br>I watch rugby on a regular basis when it is on and have gone to see both Leinster and Ireland play at home. With the Rugby World Cup on going there are matches to watch nearly everyday, unfortunately many of them are on at 11:15 on weekdays so I can't watch those ones but luckily all but one of the games involving Ireland take place on the weekend.</div>
<div align="Justify"><br>At the end of the last season I was awared the coaches player of the year at the club's president's dinner</div>
