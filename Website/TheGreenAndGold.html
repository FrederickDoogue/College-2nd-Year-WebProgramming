<div align="Justify"><br>I am a bit of a sports fan all round. I don't mind watching some random game in a random sport, except golf or cricket they are just plain boring with long gaps full of inane comentary. That aside I have three main sports I follow on a pretty regular basis. Rugby, American Football and Gaelic Football in that order of importance to myself.</div>
<div align="Justify"><br>I started off by watching Kerry playing football. I support them because my mom is from Kerry and if not for them I would have very little to celebrate by simply supporting Carlow(harsh but true). While the team isn't as good as it used to be it is full of young players who show great promise for the future of the team. Losing to Dublin in a semi final isn't something to turn your nose up at. Although what they did in the first game could almost be considered criminal, only managing to tie with a team that is one player down for an entire half. But I digress.</div>
<div align="Justify"><br>Next came rugby. I started watching rugby over five years ago. I loved the physicality of the game and the fact that Ireland was pretty good at it also helped a little. At the moment the rugby world cup is on going. <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/pools">Here</a> <!--External link-->is some information on the pool stages and knockout games.</div>
<div align="Justify"><br>Finally I started watching american football just over a year ago. With a choice of 32 teams to choose from I could have done research to pick a team that I thought would have the best chance of winning or followed in my Dad's footsteps and supported the Patriots or choose the mascot I liked the best. Instead I went with team colours. I choose not to deveate to far from my previous team colours and stuck with the green and gold. That lead me to the Green Bay Packers. An odd name compared to others like the Detroit Lions, Atlanta Falcons or Houstan Texans. I wasn't sure at the start if I had made the right choice but now coming into the 2019/2020 season I can't wait to watch the green and gold march down the feild for a touchdown.
